# darkmode-toggle-button

## Purpose

`darkmode-toggle-button` is a lightweight html/javascript-ui-component to toggle between lightmode and darkmode in a web-application.

## Idea

Today - in 2022 - apps, web-sites and web-applications often have a (usual) lightmode and a darkmode.
And that is promising.
Apps often do not have many "themes" or "skins" anymore like many apps from before.
Today, the design is an inherent part the app and is also a recognition-feature.
But the darkmode is also an important feature.

Consequently many apps have some kind of design-switch again:
A button to toggle between the built-in light- and darkmode.
That is great and improves the ui/ux for every user which uses the app in a dark environment, for example at night.

Now, the next step was that the developer of the more well-known operating systems also implemented this feature on os-level.
The user can now toggle the design of the os between light- and darkmode.
And the apps?
They mostly remain unchanged.
But many user just want to also switch every website/app/etc. to darkmode when they choose to activate darkmode for example or when the os switches to darkmode automatically dependent on the time.

Anyway: The user often want to follow the system-design on their websites/apps/etc. and want to do this in a unique way if possible.
And here comes `darkmode-toggle-button`:
A simple button to let the user decide if he wants to follow the system-design or to set lightmode/darkmode explicitly.
